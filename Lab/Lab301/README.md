# Implement the Fraction class according to the following requirements:

## Propeties:
- Numer: Numerator
- Denom: Denominator (default=1, cannot be 0)
- Count: counting #objects of this class (static)
Note: Numerator and Denominator have to in the minimal form.
      See r3 and r6.

## Constructors:
- Fraction (): default constructor
- Fraction (Fraction a): copy constructor
- Fraction (numerator, denominator)
note: increment the Count property when an object is created

## Methods
- setValue: set fraction value
- GCD: calculate Greatest Common Divisor of two integers (static)

## Operator Overloading:
many many operators need to be overloaded!!! 

## Question?
1. Is the number of Fraction objects equal to the 'new' keywords used
   in the 'main' methods? How come?
   
   >> not equal to the 'new' keywords. because just create 'Fraction r4 = r1+r2;'
	  is mean that we create another Fraction object, so number of Fraction objects doesn't eqaul to the 'new'
	  keywords used in the 'main' methods.
	   
2. Are the result, r3 and r7, in case#1 and case#2 the same? Why?
	
   >> the result of r3 and r7 in 2 cases are the same because the 'Fraction' that we use call the same 'object'
	  so the result of the r3 and r7 must be same in 2 cases. new Fraction(r3) = r3 so r7 = r3 = new Fraction(r3)

## Expected Output:

***** 3 Fraction objects have been created *****
***** 8 Fraction objects have been created *****
***** 12 Fraction objects have been created *****
